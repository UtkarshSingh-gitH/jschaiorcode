Javascript execution context ::
-this just represents how js will run and execute our scripts
-program runns in 2phases 
 
 code file --> global EC (this keywword is refered to this)
 GEC is executed in thread, js is a single thread language

 there are 2 more execution context 
 - function execution context
 - (optiona;, from mogooese) eval EC

2 pahses of JS file executing
- Memory creation phase 
- Execution phase

EXAMPLE */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
let num1 = 10
let num2 = 5
function addnum(){
    let total=num1+num2
    return total
}
let result1 = addnum(num1,num2)
let result2 = addnume(10,2)

STEP 1 - Global execution (global env) --> allocated to THIS 
STEP 2 - Memory Phase = all variables are collected and undefined are kept in it 
        num1 = undefined
        num2 = undefined
        addnum = definition
        result1 = undefined
        result2 = undefined

STEP 3 - Execution Phase = now values are assigned 
       val1 executed and value 10 assigned 
       val2 executed and value 5 assigned 
       addnum is not executed as no work is happening definition already stored
       result1 gets executed and now a new SANDBOX is created where we run all the phases(executional context) aagin
       for the addNum function.
       So global is defined one but for every function call a new execution phase is created.
